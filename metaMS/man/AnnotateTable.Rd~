AnnotateTable
}
\description{
Function to annotate a peak table by using a database. It recalls \code{AnnotateFeature} 
}
\usage{
AnnotateTable(peaktable, errf, DB, settings)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{peaktable}{A peaktable (matrix) with three column corresponding
    to mz,rt and I values}
  \item{errf}{The file containing the error function used to predict the
    tolerance.} 
  \item{DB}{}
  \item{settings}{}
}
\details{
 The function annotates a table of features by using a specific
 \code{txt} database. The error function is used to calculate the mass
 tolerance ina a \code{predict(errf, data.frame(M = input[1], logI =
   log10(input[3])))} call.  An annotation is considered reliable if two
 features associated to the same compound are present. Their retention
 times should differ of less than \code{rtval}.  
}
\value{
  A list with the following elements
  \item{annotation.table}{A \code{data.frame} withe the results of the annotation and the reference to the DB}
  \item{compounds}{The names of the annotated compounds}
  \item{IDs}{The IDs of the annotated compounds}
  \item{multiple.annotations}{The features with multiple annotations}
  \item{ann.features}{The features with annotation}
