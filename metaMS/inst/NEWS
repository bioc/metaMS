Version 0.99.1: changes w.r.t. 0.99.0
- nSlaves now is an argument for functions runGC, runLC and
peakDetection, rather than a setting. Done, the field is also taken out
from the FEMsettings data object.
- printString and friends no longer use "cat" but rather "message". Done.
- explicit export of functions that can / should be called by metaMS
users in the NAMESPACE file. Done.
- reduced the number of packages in the "Depends" field in
DESCRIPTION: "Rcpp" is only included because otherwise warnings were
seen during the building and installation of the package - not quite
clear why. Issue also has appeared for other packages (e.g. Risa).
- removed the "Enhances" field in DESCRIPTION since it did not seem
appropriate. Done.
- CITATION added to the inst directory. Done.
- NEWS added to the inst directory. This file: done.

Still do to:
- during building the package R complains that the methods package is
used but not declared. "Error" from xcms? CAMERA? another package?
- to improve speed of installation, checking and vignette building all
intermediate results needed to illustrate certain functionality are
precomputed and saved in an RData file. Vignettes and examples are
changed accordingly. GC vignette finishes within 15 seconds, examples
even faster. LC still to do.
- add S4 class for settings, put the FEMsettings in this format, and
remove the old FEMsettigns object. File metaMSsettings.R has been
created; now we need to give it a manual page that shows how the three
(four, if we include the orbitrap settings) sets of settings are
created.
- add tests - see Laurent comments on Unit Testing



Changes of 0.99.2 w.r.t 0.99.1
- added import(methods) and used the devel version of mzR to get rid
  of warnings during building and checking 
- Added S4 class for settings, also export class and methods in
  NAMESPACE. Also included FEMsettings objects as S4 objects and
  changed where necessary man pages, vignettes and documentation.
  Also slots instName and chrom are now accessible through the
  accessor function, as are the individual slots.
