Changes in version 0.99.2 
- added import(methods) and used the devel version of mzR to get rid
  of warnings during building and checking - nevertheless I still get
Warning: class "C++Object" is defined (with package slot ‘Rcpp’) but no metadata object found to revise subclass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ‘.GlobalEnv’
  while building the package...
- Added S4 class for settings, also export class and methods in
  NAMESPACE. Also included FEMsettings objects as S4 objects and
  changed where necessary man pages, vignettes and documentation.
  Also slots instName and chrom are now accessible through the
  accessor function, as are the individual slots.
- significant speed up of vignette building and examples by including
  precalculated results.
- added tests using the testthat package, specifically focusing on the
  metaMS part (so not testing xcms peak picking which can lead to
  different results across versions). Also added BiocGenerics and
  RUnit to the "Suggests" packages in the description file.
